# Team Project #1

Write classes to model a shopping list.

Make an Item class that represents a grocery item's name and price, such as tissues for $3.

Also implement an ItemOrder class that represents a shopper's desire to purchase a given item in a given quantity, such as fives boxes of tissues.

You might wish to implement bulk-discounted items, such as two boxes of tissues for $4, which would bring the cost of the given item order of 2 + 2 + 1 boxes of tissues
to $4 + $4 + $3, or $11.00.

Lastly, implement a ShoppingCart class that stores ItemOrders in an ArrayList and allows item orders to be added to, removed from, or searched for in the cart.

The cart should be able to report the total of the all item orders it currently carries
